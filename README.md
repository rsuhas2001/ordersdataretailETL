Overview: 

Extracted and Transformed Data: Pulled retail order data from an external API into Python, handled null values, removed redundant columns, created calculated fields, and standardized date formats — ensuring clean and consistent data.

Database Integration: Connected Python to a SQL database and designed a well-structured table (df_orders), optimizing data storage and enabling efficient querying and analysis.

Advanced SQL Analysis: Developed and executed complex SQL queries using CTEs and window functions to identify top-performing products, analyze year-over-year sales trends, and uncover high-growth product categories — driving strategic business decisions.
